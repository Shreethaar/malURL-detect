1. Backend (Python with MiTMProxy):
- Interception and URL collection
Options: MiTMProxy, Android Debug Bridge

Technical Overview:
1. Android App Development:
- Android app that has Accessibility Service, to monitor and interact with other apps
- Capture URLs
2. Uses a VPN service within the app to monitor network traffic

2. URL Filtering and Prioritizaiton: 
- Whitelist Management 
- Heurisitcs-Based Filtering

3. VirusTotal API integration:
- Rate Limiting and Caching
- Error Handling

4. Additional Threat Intelligence Feeds:
- Threat Database
- Machine Learning Models

Database:
- Reporting 
- Collects Clean website URL


Method to access: 
- through application layer
- through physical layer
- bypass 

- another tools for virustotal, is snort for open-source IDS server
- flutter service and library for access service-layer (Kotlin)


ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
1. URL and Domain Blacklists
- Maintain a database of known malicious URLs and domains. When users access a URL, your app can check it against your blacklist and warn them if it's flagged as suspicious. Regularly update the database with known malicious URLs and domains from sources using APIs

Sources:
PhishTank
Google Safe Browsing
Spamhaus
MalwareDomains

2. Heuristic Analysis: Implement algorithms that analyze the content of web pages and app for patterns or characteristics associated with malware. This can be a complex task, but it can help identify potential threats without directly intercepting network traffic.
